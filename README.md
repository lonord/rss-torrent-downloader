# rss-torrent-downloader
This project is an RSS feed-based torrent downloader that automatically fetches and processes new episodes from subscribed feeds. Upon detecting a new episode, it automatically extracts the torrent download link and submits it to the Aria2 downloader for seamless, hands-off downloading.
